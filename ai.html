In each of these sections, you would want to include detailed explanations, visual aids (like diagrams or screenshots), step-by-step tutorials, and code snippets that learners can run and modify themselves.

Here is a simple code example for training a very basic GAN on the MNIST dataset, which could be included in the section on GANs:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, LeakyReLU
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Load the dataset (for illustration purposes, we simplify it)
(X_train, _), (_, _) = mnist.load_data()
X_train = X_train / 255.0
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 784)

# Generator model
g_input = Input(shape=(100,))
H = Dense(256)(g_input)
H = LeakyReLU(0.2)(H)
g_output = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(H)
generator = Model(g_input, g_output)

# Discriminator model
d_input = Input(shape=(784,))
H = Dense(256)(d_input)
H = LeakyReLU(0.2)(H)
d_output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(H)
discriminator = Model(d_input, d_output)
discriminator.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam())

# Combined model (stacked generator and discriminator)
discriminator.trainable = False
gan_input = Input(shape=(100,))
x = generator(gan_input)
gan_output = discriminator(x)
gan = Model(gan_input, gan_output)
gan.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam())

# Training loop (simplified for illustration)
for epoch in range(1000):
    # Sample random noise
    noise = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=[batch_size, 100])
    # Generate fake MNIST images from noise
    generated_images = generator.predict(noise)
    # Get a batch of real MNIST images
    image_batch = X_train[np.random.randint(0, X_train.shape[0], size=batch_size)]
    # ...

# Note: Full training loop would include training the discriminator and generator
